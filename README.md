# AI to automate savings

Building AI course project

## Summary

Saving money is difficult. Automating savings from the daily bank account to mutual funds or savings account, when the balance is high enough would make this process easy and automatic for the individual.


## Background

Having some savings makes the difficulties in our daily lives little easier to cope with. Living paycheck to paycheck makes one very vulnerable to problems that could happen to any of us. Many more people could have the opportunity to save a portion of their income, if it was made easier for them. 


## How is it used?

Automated saving tool could:
* Assess the monthly income and spending
* Identify when extra saving could be made, while maintaining large enough balance for future expences


## Data sources and AI methods
Data would come from the banks using PSD2 open banking API's. The same APIs could be used to make the automated payments.

Bank transaction history could be used to predict future expenses. When the cash balance is high enough, savings could be made. The details about AI model are left for later.

## Challenges

Trust to the service provider would need to be very high, so that the individuals would be ready accept the access.

## What next?

This project would be best done in collaboration with a major bank.
